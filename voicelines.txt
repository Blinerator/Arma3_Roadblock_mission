Listen up Marines!  As you know, we were forced to temporarily withdraw from our radar dome in Anbar Tappeh.  You know this because you fucking lost it!  We were able to re-capture it at 1700 hours, but all our detachments on the east side of the Kunduz river were forced to withdraw.  Without radar support, we had no way to detect or repel airstrikes, and those goat fuckers have started hammerin Omar Khel harder than Jody's hammering your wife.  As you can imagine, every towel head in that city is trying to emigrate their brown asses to our side of the river.  We need you to man the bridge nearest to the city.  Godfather is uninterested in an open border policy; he wants every car stopped and searched before passing.  Your mission is to hold that crossing like your boyfriend's dick, so hold it tight, and make it hard for the enemy to get across...

Here are your rules of engagement.  We expect hostile scouting parties, but don't shoot unless you're shot at first.  If you find contraband, you can either detain or reject the individual.  Now I personally don't give a shit if you blast every haji in a ten mile radius, but Godfather wants to keep positive relations with the local populace.  He's already pissed, and my job is to keep him from further pissin, so you cock suckers WILL follow the rules.  Good luck.
